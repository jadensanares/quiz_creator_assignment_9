    # Asking the user to input the correct answer that is found in one of the following letter choices: (a, b, c, d)
        # For consistency, the letter input should be lowercased, we will be converting them.

    # All of the questions, choices, and the correct answer shall be saved to a separate file (.txt)
        # Define a function save_to_file()

    # Make a visual display feedback for the questions entered (for more convenience visually in letting the user know what answer options are correct or not)
        # Make a loop for each answer option
        # If the option is the correct answer, print it with a green square emoji text (ðŸŸ©).
