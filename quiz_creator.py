# Assignment 9: Quiz Creator
# Create a program that ask user for a question, it will also ask for 4 possible answer (a,b,c,d) and the correct answer. Write the collected data to a text file. Ask another question until the user chose to exit.
# Hint: 
# On the next assignment, you will create the Quiz program that read the output file of the Quiz Creator. The user will answer the randomly selected question and check if the answer is correct.
# Format the data written on the text file so it is easier the read on the next assignment.
# Feel free to use any library


# All of the questions, choices, and the correct answer shall be saved to a separate file (.txt)
     # Define a function save_to_file()
        # A text file will open in appen mode.
        # Write the question.
        # Write each option with its respective label (a, b, c, d).
        # Write the correct answer.
        # Format the txt file by adding a space between entries for better readability to the user.
