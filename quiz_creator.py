# Format the data written on the text file so it is easier the read on the next assignment.
# Feel free to use any library


# All of the questions, choices, and the correct answer shall be saved to a separate file (.txt)
     # Define a function save_to_file()
        # A text file will open in appen mode.
        # Write the question.
        # Write each option with its respective label (a, b, c, d).
        # Write the correct answer.
        # Format the txt file by adding a space between entries for better readability to the user.
